  Upon learning the basics of Javascript from videos on the internet, I did not think it was anything special. Merely another programming language that I could say I was familiar with. However, as I started playing with it more and using the language to solve various problems, I realized how creative you can be in utilizing the language. As someone who came from a primarily C/C++ background, I was taught very fundamental principles of programming that could be applied to multiple problems found in algorithms. But with JS, these principles are greatly expanded, and with flexible objects like first class functions, functions that can essentially be treated as objects, the ability to come out with innovative solutions became more accessible to me. I have enjoyed my time with JS so far, and I hope to learn more so that I can become more open-minded and approach problems with a more creative mindset. 

  My experience with athletic software engineering has been good so far. My experience with algorithms has been helping me with the problems so far, and I have been applying my knowledge from C to help me adapt to writing JS code. I think these have been helpful in training my hands to write in a different language. It is also stressful since I have to finish these problems within a time constraint, and will continue to grow stressful as my grades depend on my ability to solve them within the given time. However, I think in the end, it will be very a unique learning experience that I find enjoyable.
