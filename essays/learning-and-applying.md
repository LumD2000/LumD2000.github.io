## Coding Standards

The importance of coding standards is something I did not understand until this class. Coding standards are preset formats for specific code patterns that ensure consistency in your applications. If not for this, I definitely would have had a harder time learning how to code efficiently in this class. Outside of this class, I think coding standards is something I will try to use in other programming languages in the future. The ability to see how code would be formatted properly makes it easier to read, and helps in understanding how each line in the code can interact with each other. 

## Design Patterns

In this class I also learned that I have been using some design patterns since I started learning as a computer engineer. Design patterns are well tested strategies to use when solving problems that fit within a certain category. In other aspects of my programming I have learned to apply certain techniques in several similar situations involving OOP such as game development. Even outside of programming, the idea of using defined procedures to solve similar problems pops up quite often in the world of engineering. 

## Agile Project Management

Agile project Management was something I had experienced before this class, particularly in one of my junior year projects in engineering. This type of project management involves breaking down main objectives into smaller divisible and assignable tasks that each member of the team can take on. This is really helpful when trying to understand the scale of the project that we are working on. The ability to make large objectives easier to tackle for the team is super important, even outside of software engineering in general. Many projects could be large in scale that involves multiple teams and objectives. Without the ability to break down these tasks, a lot of these projects would not even be able to get off the ground, much less succeed. 

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun learning about the concepts in this class, and even though some of them I felt I already knew about, this class helped refined my existing knowledge of the topics, and gave me a lot of new ideas on how to apply these concepts.
