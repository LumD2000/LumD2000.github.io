Software engineering is a very interesting topic as it require extensive amounts of technical knowledge to solve problems in our world using technology. It is an overall great skill to have as it gives us an avenue to express our problem solving skills in multiple aspects of our life, not limited to the computer. 

For this class, I am looking forward to creating something with other people as I wish to develop my collaboration skills and communication skills with others. Looking to the future I wish to be able to work with multiple languages so that I can be flexible in different environments and industries.

The future for holds a lot of potential, and I wish to be exposed to many different fields so that I can understand and learn more about what I want to do for a career. Developing my skills as a computer engineer is just a part of that.
