summary: A small game that I developed for my final project in EE 205 (Object Oriented Programming).
---

 

The game that I developed in EE205 for my final project involves controlling a player object that can move along the vertical axis of the screen and can shoot bullets. The objective of the game is to defeat the boss, which is just a single enemy that shoots out bullets toward the player in a controlled pattern.
