summary: A small game that I developed for my final project in EE 205 (Object Oriented Programming).
---

 

The game that I developed in EE205 for my final project involves controlling a player object that can move along the vertical axis of the screen and can shoot bullets. The objective of the game is to defeat the boss, which is just a single enemy that shoots out bullets toward the player in a controlled pattern. 

I was mainly responsible for developing the movement and shooting mechanics of the player as well the graphical aspect of the game such as the textures and player models, which were images. 

This project was the culmination of my experience with C++ programming, and overall OOP application, as it allowed me to apply the various concepts I learned in class to a field that I was interested in.
