summary: My final project for ICS 314 (Software Engineering I). It is a web application that allows users to look at available food vendors and their menu at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It also has functionality for vendors themselves to edit their profile and add or edit existing menu items.

This is a web application that I built with a team in my software engineering course. It uses all of the major concepts taught in class, such as using and controlling Git, React and Meteor components, and more. The purpose of this application is to give intended users the ability to peruse the available food on campus and sort menu items through vendor, so they can be able to see what they would like to eat before going to the actual vendor. It also has a review system set in place so that users can leave comments behind on a vendor's profile on how good/bad the food was. 

I was responsible for creating the page that displays the vendor profiles and the menu page for each vendor. I was also part of instantiating the database with most of the necessary data, such as the vendors, and menu items to display. 

This project was very challenging in the way that I had to work with other team members to create the same application. Sometimes things would go wrong due to differently implemented code for interacting systems. This taught me to catch merge conflict errors in Git early on so we would not run into more problems as we got closer to the deadline for this project.
