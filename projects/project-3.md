Using 123D Design, I modeled the weapon of my favorite character in League of Legends, a free-to-play video game on PC. A picture is shown of the concept art of the weapon, not my actual model. This project was done in high school, and was my final project in my digital design class. 

I was wholly responsible for the creation of the weapon in the program, including all of the modeling and its 3D printing process. The 3D printing process failed due to it having too many complex shapes for the printer to accurately print. 

Using this program, I was able to learn how to use the tools of 123D design, as well as basic geometric principles, to create a model.
