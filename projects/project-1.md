This year's Community Innovation Mentorship Program (CIMP) involved creating a web-based solution that quantified the storm water utility fee for commercial property owners. This 
was done through multiple sessions of brainstorming to come up with all the possible features that our website should have, such as the ability to highlight certain features of land that was to be considered pervious or impervious surfaces.
