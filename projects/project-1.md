summary: My team developed a prototype website that allowed users to calculate the storm water utility property of various properties on the island of Oahu.
---


This year's Community Innovation Mentorship Program (CIMP) involved creating a web-based solution that quantified the storm water utility fee for commercial property owners. This 
was done through multiple sessions of brainstorming to come up with all the possible features that our website should have, such as the ability to highlight certain features of land that was to be considered pervious or impervious surfaces. 

I was responsible for mostly front-end development, such as adding front end features to the website that the user could interact with, such as a newsletter module that allowed users to subscribe to a newsletter after inputting an email address.

I learned a lot about the git workflow from this project, and it was my first experience collaborating with other engineers to design a solution to a real world problem.
